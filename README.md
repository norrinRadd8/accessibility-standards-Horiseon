# 01 HTML CSS Horiseon: Code Refactor

## Description

As a marketing agency, Horiseon want a codebase that follows accessibility standards
so that their own site is optimized for search engines.

This will be carried out by refactoring the HTML and CSS code. I aim to clean up the code by;

* Semantic HTML elements placed throughout the source code
* HTML elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
* Image and icon elements contain accessible `alt` attributes
* Heading attributes fall in sequential order
* Title elements contain a concise, descriptive title
